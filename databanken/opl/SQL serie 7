radioprogram rp on rp.radioprogramid = rb.radioprogramid WHERE rp.title like 'Night vibe')

WHERE rp.title LIKE 'Hitstorm' ) 
intersect 
(SELECT DISTINCT t.genre from track t inner join playlistitem pl on t.trackid = pl.trackid inner join radiobroadcast rb on pl.radiobroadcastid = rb.radiobroadcastid 
inner join radioprogram rp on rb.radioprogramid = rp.radioprogramid WHERE rp.title LIKE 'Disco Stoops')
